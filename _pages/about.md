I am a PhD candidate at [Nagoya University](https://www.nagoya-u.ac.jp/), specializing in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. My research focuses on computer vision, multimodal recognition, and deep learning, with applications in solving real-world problems.

Currently, I am a student researcher at [RIKEN National Science Institute](https://www.riken.jp/), working on the Guardian Robot Project. My research involves open-world action detection and multi-view multi-modal action recognition by analyzing multimodal sensory data. 

Additionally, I am in charge at the [Center for Artificial Intelligence, Mathematical and Data Science](https://www.mds.nagoya-u.ac.jp/), collaborating with Japanese corporations to develop practical AI solutions.
